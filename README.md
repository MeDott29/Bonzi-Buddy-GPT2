# Bonzi-Buddy-GPT2
A simple recreation of the BonziBUDDY desktop assistant in Python using a GPT 2 model. You can interact and talk with Bonzi, a friendly purple gorilla from the early 2000s.

When loading the program, keep in mind it may take a while to load depending on if it has to train his AI. To skip the training process, download the bonzi_model folder in the repository. If you'd like to change the AI, you can change personality.txt how you like it (remember to delete the current bonzi_model to retrain). Once he has been trained once, his model will be saved in a folder called bonzi_model and will be used to reduce startup time.

Once the program loads, Bonzi will swing in and you can begin to interact with him.

Press the buttons in the upper left corner and he'll do animations.

Use the white box on the bottom to type to him, after pressing enter he'll take your input and create a response. He'll then say his response in text-to-speech, I couldn't get his original voice unfortunately so it's current just Microsoft David.

Do keep in mind that GPT 2 is a bit older and his model far from perfect. His AI may say some incoherant or unhinged things, but I think it's fun to mess with!
